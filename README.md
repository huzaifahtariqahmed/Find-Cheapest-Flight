# Find Cheapest Flight
Final Project for CS 102 - Data Structures and Algorithms.

International flights have a very complicated network, with several routes available to reach a specific location. In today's world, with rising inflation rates, deciding which path is best suited to you is quite tough. Therefore, this is a simple application to find the cheapest available flights from the dataset given.

## Functionalities
### 1. Finding Cheapest Flight(s)
This program converts the given dataset into a Graph ADT, and applies a Brute Force algorithm - inspired by Breadth First Search - to find the top 3 cheapest options available.

### 2. Adding the Flights
Adds the given information into the Graph and then into the current dataset.

### 3. Remove the Flights
Removes the given information from the Graph and the current dataset

## User Interface
A simple GUI was made using the built-in Tkinter library in Python 3. 
The application accepts inputs through text-boxes and buttons. The output is also displayed on the screen.
